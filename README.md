Very often it happens that Wikipedia entries are "tidied up" as it happens with entries of (British) judges. Called Edit War.
Their dirty work, their failures corrected by upper instances(in case the court victim has the money and 
has been allowed to go to an upper instance is removed very soon after it has been entered. 
The good thing, its there. They cannot delete the historic entries.
Right now this is a quick and dirty attempt to display all what has been changed during the existence of the entry about the person or subject. 
To be flexible Paython 3 together with Jupyter Notebooks was used. Also some help from Chat GPT. 
Feel freee to take and improve. The last entry should be shown. Also it would be good to have the date and the persone responsible for a version is there. 
If it makes sense to agregate or just to search need to be seen. For sure there are people who have good or better ideas. Maybe there is already something better.
